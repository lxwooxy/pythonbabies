# Kopi or Teh
Using Tkinter to generate a coffee order that a kopi auntie in Singapore would understand, especially if your drink specifications are more complicated than a Milo Peng (my order) or yuān yāng shǎo tián, which my tango teacher made me order every day. That or a Milo Gao, which I can get behind too.
